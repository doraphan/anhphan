											<font color="#000000">Hosted by <a href="https://www.cisco.com/">Cisco</a></li>, MentorMe Program gives female students from technology and business area insightful knowledge to the IT world. Each student who signs up as a mentee will be connected to a mentor who is an expert in their area. 
                        In other words, MentorMe is the connecting bridge for students and their potential exposure to practical IT/Business setting via tailored guidance, experience and advice from Cisco mentors.</font>

											<font color="#000000">The 12-week program is designed with the focus of assisting the mentees in discovering their career path and equipping them with essential skills for interviews. 
                        Additionally, as networking is also crucial to achieving professional goals, MentorMe also allows mentees to build their relationship with their mentors and other fellow mentees. Statistics showed that in 2019, there were <b>186</b> mentees and <b>183</b> mentors, which are outstanding figures! </font>

												<font size="3">Even though I have had 5 years of experience in professional workplace, it does not mean that I am confident. That is to say, I can be a qualified content writer and internal team communicator but there is a great deal of insecurity coexisting in me.
                          I have been playing so well in my safe zone. I cannot even finish the elementary level of tree surfing. Nevertheless, it is not a typical example since some people have the fear of altitude <i>(acrophobia)</i> and it is chronic. It is understandable that the struggle to win over the temptation of your comfort zone takes a lifetime. I used to have such bad eye sight, which resulted in my wearing thick glasses since my elementary school. 
                          My Lasik surgery in 2014 was successful and my eye vision was brought back to 10/10. Sadly, it cured my eyes but not my confidence. Perhaps I had worn glasses for almost the entire life that when taking them out, I was not reallyâ€¦myself. That is the case when you get so used to something, you think you are weak without it. My job can initially get you the instinctive feeling of me being introvert and it is true.
                          I enjoy being me, there is no doubt being an introvert gives you so many bonuses. 
                          But I want to be more than just a quiet person and no matter how talented you are, if you do not show the right attitude and skills, how can you earn recognition from people? As an international student in a developed country, I find a plenty of barriers that limit me. But what matter is coming out of your shell. That is why I decide not to let my imaginary obstacles block me from advancing.</font>

												<font size="3">I cannot express how happy I was to get selected. As stated by Cisco, mentors were handpicked for mentees based on their interest. My mentor has had more than 10 years in the industry and he confessed to being an introvert too (great!). 
                          I could see that I have a lot of things to learn from respected figures like him.</font>

												<font size="3">The reason why I started this blog is to write down my reflection for each MentorMe session. When reading it, I can see my step-by-step progress. 
                          Besides that, my friends always tell me: "Finding a job in Melbourne is a job itself", writing resume, developing personal brand and interview skills are essential to every candidate, I hope that with skills I earn from Cisco, I can help people out there who are also finding a job with my blog.</font>
