							</br>
							<div align="left"><p><font size="3"><b><font color="#000000">I am Anh Phan. You may be wondering why there is another Dora Phan in the Github domain but it is also me.
								I use the name Dora at my workplace but some of my friends call my real first name, so you can call me either Dora or Anh at your best convenience. I am happy anyways!</font></b></font></p>
								 <p><font size="3"><b><font color="#000000">You can easily find my professional profile on my Resume but I will be glad to share with you some of my basic information. 
									 Below is a list of ascending order from 1 to 4 that links with one fact about me: </font></b></font></p>
								<ul class="LinkList">
								<li><p><font size="3"><b><font color="#000000">One:</font size="5"></b><font size="3"> I have been staying faithful in pursuing only <b>one</b> career path - writing. People love to write and so do I.
									Since my Bachelor graduation in 2012, I have been working as a content executive specialised in website content, social media and e-marketing. I write in both English and Vietnamese but most of the time, I deal with the previous. 
									I believe that writing exists in multiple types of forms, when programmers code, they write, when accountants record invoices, they write, etc. That is to say, I do not have limited use of the word "writing".</font></p></font></li>
								<li><p><font size="3"><b><font color="#000000">Two:</font size="5"></b><font size="3"> I have <b>two</b> educational levels: Bachelor of Commerce and Master of Analytics, both of which are conducted in RMIT. 
									My Bachelor started in 2009 and ended in 2012 while my Master is a 2-year program and I expect to have graduated by 2020. Unbeknown to you, my Bachelor major is accounting. 
									Does it seem to be quite contradicting to my career debut? In spite of it, I was equipped with general knowledge of marketing and business in RMIT. Therefore, I did not feel like there was a huge gap in actual business setting. 
									Besides that, it is up to the job positions that you will get trained, but it is the matter of how much effort you put in completing your task. 
									With my experience of writing, I think I will be able to produce reports for data analysis. 
									So Bachelor degree - my career - My Master, they do not seem to be connected but actually they do, they are relevant.</font></p></font></li>
								<li><p><font size="3"><b><font color="#000000">Three:</font size="5"></b><font size="3"> I am the owner of <b>three</b> blogs and this is the third one. I started my first Wordpress blog during my university days in which I wrote fictions and translated entertainment news. 
									My second blog was created as a result of my inspirations for a national travel blogger. Compared with the first one, I invested a great deal on the second one by purchasing the domain and hosting, making it a professional website. My main content is travelling, lifestyle, and music/movie reviews. Believe or not, there are things in your life you expect the least that will make a remarkable turning chapter for you.
									I initially got an offer from my previous employer who said that he was hugely impressed with my blog. Of course, I put it together with other professional works but it was ultimately my blog that got the attention. And finally, here we are at my third one. My familiar coding languages are R, Python and ASP.NET. My first two blogs are in Wordpress and with the third one using Github, I hope to challenge myself in a coding environment instead of conventional built-in CMS. 
									Hence, I can practice my skills. Just to let you know that I always have issues remembering the brackets () in code, which unavoidably results in my waste of hours fixing them when I break them.</font></p></font></li>
								<li><p><font size="3"><b><font color="#000000">Four:</font size="5"></b><font size="3"> I worked for <b>four</b> IT companies in my 5 years of professional career. In other words, at average, I spent 1 year and a few months for each of them. I am fully aware that to some people, I could be a typical so-called job hopper. But how can I hide it away when each employer I had worked with, I learned valuable lessons that could benefit my future career prospect, earned recognitions and especially made wonderful network? 
									The first company that I joined is a Japan-invested company. As a fresh graduate, I was lucky to be in a team of experienced senior and there is a project that always sits on the top of my CV. It is a website portal that connects between Vietnam and Japan. 
									Particularly, if a Japanese enterprise wants to seek for a partner in Vietnam, they will look up in the website. According to Google Analytics, it hit more than 10,000 sessions per day and there were more than 1,000 companies that I wrote information and entered till I left. My second company is a start-up IT comprised of millennials. They are lovely friends that I am happy that we have stayed connected till now.
									Thanks to them, I knew how to code and differentiate coding languages. There was a legendary joke that I used to tell people so that they had some ideas how clueless I had been before:</br>
									<br>Boss: "Hey Anh, we are lacking human resources. For our new projects, we must have more coders. Can you help me to draft some job recruitments? After you finish, ask other guys to check it for you."</br>
									<br>Me: "Sure sir." </br>
									<br>After composing the job recruitment, I sent it to my IT colleagues to double check it before posting on recruitment platforms. Since it is an IT job recruitment, they would know it better than me.</br>
									<br>My recruitment post: "Hi, we are Pure Solutions and we need some people who know how to do Ruby on Nails to join our team. Fresh, young and fun environment. You will love to work with us."</br>
									<br>My colleague: "You have just turned our company into a salon. It is Ruby on Rails, not Ruby on Nails."</br>
									<br>It is surely an unforgettable memory to me. After quitting the company, I decided to have a break and remotely worked for the Japan-based company of my former Japanese boss in which I was responsible for writing Vietnamese content for a Japanese tourism website. As a Japan-holic, this job fascinated me and my social media skills boosted its visitors significantly and made my boss happy. 
										However, the website was shut down because the top managers wanted to shift the business into e-commerce, hence, leaving no job for tourism information. Inevitably, I left not only the job... but also a great impression to my manager who was very supportive of my further education pursuit in Australia. Having accumulated much digital experience, I landed the same job position in an Australia-owned company which was also my last company before my flying to Australia. 
										If the first Japanese company preferred PHP, the second Vietnamese one used Ruby on Rails, then in the last Australia one, ASP.NET was their language. Under the supervision of my Australian boss, my writing skills got enhanced and particularly shaped to the Australian audience. I was delighted that I did not allow my job title to frame me into same repetitive writing tasks. Not only my writing, I also had exposure to practice design and coding. 
										In here, it instilled on me a new passion for data.  </font></p></font></li>
