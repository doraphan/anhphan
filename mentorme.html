											<font color="#000000">Hosted by <a href="https://www.cisco.com/">Cisco</a></li>, MentorMe Program gives female students from technology and business area insightful knowledge to the IT world. Each student who signs up as a mentee will be connected to a mentor who is an expert in their area. 
                        In other words, MentorMe is the connecting bridge for students and their potential exposure to practical IT/Business setting via tailored guidance, experience and advice from Cisco mentors.</font>

											<font color="#000000">The 12-week program is designed with the focus of assisting the mentees in discovering their career path and equipping them with essential skills for interviews. 
                        Additionally, as networking is also crucial to achieving professional goals, MentorMe also allows mentees to build their relationship with their mentors and other fellow mentees. Statistics showed that in 2019, there were <b>186</b> mentees and <b>183</b> mentors, which are outstanding figures! </font>

												<font size="3">Even though I have had 5 years of experience in professional workplace, it does not mean that I am confident. That is to say, I can be a qualified content writer and internal team communicator but there is a great deal of insecurity coexisting in me.
                          I have been playing so well in my safe zone. I cannot even finish the elementary level of tree surfing. Nevertheless, it is not a typical example since some people have the fear of altitude <i>(acrophobia)</i> and it is chronic. How about this? I used to have such bad eye sight, which resulted in my wearing thick glasses since my elementary school. 
                          My Lasik surgery in 2014 was successful and my eye vision was brought back to 10/10. It cured my eyes but not my confidence. Perhaps I had worn glasses for almost the entire life that when taking them out, I was not really…myself. That is the case when you get so used to something, you think you are weak without it. My job can initially get you the instinctive feeling of me being introvert and it is true.
                          I enjoy being me, there is no doubt being an introvert gives you so many bonuses. 
                          But I want to be more than just a quiet person and no matter how talented you are, if you do not show the right attitude and skills, how can you earn recognition from people? As an international student in a developed country, I find a plenty of barriers that limit me. But what matter is coming out of your shell. That is why I decide not to let my imaginary obstacles block me from advancing.</font>

												<font size="3">I cannot express how happy I was to get selected. As stated by Cisco, mentors were handpicked for mentees based on their interest. My mentor has had more than 10 years in the industry and he confessed to being an introvert too (great!). 
                          I could see that I have a lot of things to learn from respected figures like him.</font>

											<font size="3">
												<font size="3">The reason why I started this blog is to write down my reflection for each MentorMe session. When reading it, I can see my step-by-step progress. 
                          Besides that, my friends always tell me: “Finding a job in Melbourne is a job itself”, writing resume, developing personal brand and interview skills are essential to every candidate, I hope that with skills I earn from Cisco, I can help my friends out there who are also finding a job, by reading my blog.</font>

													<font color="#000000">Four:</font size="5">
												</b>
												<font size="3"> I worked for <b>four</b> IT companies in my 5 years of professional career.
													In other words, at average, I spent 1 year and a few months for each of them. I am fully
													aware that to some people, I could be a typical so-called job hopper. But how can I hide
													it away when each employer I had worked with, I learned valuable lessons that could
													benefit my future career prospect, earned recognitions and especially made wonderful
													network?
													The first company that I joined is a Japan-invested company. As a fresh graduate, I was
													lucky to be in a team of experienced senior and there is a project that always sits on the
													top of my CV. It is an online portal that connects between Vietnam and Japan.
													Particularly, if a Japanese enterprise wants to seek for a partner in Vietnam, they will
													look up in the website. According to Google Analytics, it hit more than 10,000 sessions
													per day and there were more than 1,000 companies that I wrote their information and
													entered to the website till I left. My second company is a start-up IT comprised of
													millennials. They are lovely friends that I am happy that we have stayed connected till
													now.
													Thanks to them, I knew how to code and differentiate coding languages. There was a
													legendary joke that I used to tell people so that they had some ideas how clueless I had
													been before:</br>
													<p class="tab">
													<br>Boss: "Hey Anh, we are lacking human resources. For our new projects, we must have
													more coders. Can you help me to draft some job recruitments? After you finish, ask other
													guys to check it for you."</br>
													<br>Me: "Sure sir." </br>
													<br>After composing the job recruitment as per my boss' request, I sent it to my IT colleagues to double check it
													before posting it on the recruitment platforms. Since it is an IT job recruitment, they would
													be more familiar with it than me.</br>
													<br>My recruitment post: "Hi, we are Pure Solutions and we need some people who know how
													to do Ruby on Nails to join our team. Fresh, young and fun environment. You will love to
													work with us."</br>
													<br>My colleagues: "You have just turned our company into a salon. It is Ruby on Rails,
													not Ruby on Nails."</br>
													</p>
													<br>It is surely an unforgettable memory to me. After quitting the company, I decided to
													have a break and remotely worked for the Japan-based company of my former Japanese boss in
													which I was responsible for writing Vietnamese content for a Japanese tourism website. As
													a Japan-holic, this job fascinated me and my social media skills boosted its visitors
													significantly and made my boss happy.
													However, the website was shut down because the top managers wanted to shift the business
													into e-commerce, hence, leaving no job for tourism information. Inevitably, I left not
													only the job... but also a great impression to my manager who was very supportive of my
													further education pursuit in Australia. Having accumulated much digital experience, I
													landed the same job position in an Australia-owned company which was also my last company
													before my flying to Australia.
													If the first Japanese company preferred PHP, the second Vietnamese one used Ruby on Rails,
													then in the last Australia one, ASP.NET was their language. Under the supervision of my
													Australian boss, my writing skills got enhanced and particularly shaped to the Australian
													audience. I was delighted that I did not allow my job title to frame me into same
													repetitive writing tasks. Not only my writing, I also had exposure to practice design and
													coding.
													In here, it instilled on me a new passion for data. </font>
